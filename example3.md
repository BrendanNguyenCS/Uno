# Third example of a game of Uno

Note: Please keep in mind that the current game rules dictate that a player unable to play a card must draw one from the deck. If they are able to play a card, they may do so. If they are unable to play the card they drew, they must pass their turn.

**The alternate drawing rule and the draw four feature are active in this example**

The game parameters are as follows:
```json

  "countPlayers": 6,
  "countInitialCardsPerPlayer": 8,
  "countDigitCardsPerColor": 3,
  "countSpecialCardsPerColor": 3,
